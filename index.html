      I am a junior computer science major that comes from a small town in rural
      Minnesota. I wanted to become a computer science major so that I could
      travel while I work.

      broadcast.

    <!-- It is recommended to use the anchor tag to use buttons, but I personally prefer using the actual button tag
    because the anchor tag requires you to style it to look like a button using CSS -->
    <!-- _blank causes the button to open the link in a new tab instead of the current tab -->
    <button onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com', '_blank');">
      Youtube

      I didn't get a phone until I was in 10th grade in highschool so I've
      always used Youtube for music over spotify. However Youtube sucks at
      randomizing their playlists so I use this site to randomize it better.

      Github is honestly a very amazingly useful website. You can post any
      project for anyone to see and check out. Likewise you can see anyone elses
      projects which can be some of the most useful software or tools you could
      possibly find.

        This was made using basic HTML and CSS but I recommend using this as a
        chance to learn bootstrap and JavaScript if you haven't already
